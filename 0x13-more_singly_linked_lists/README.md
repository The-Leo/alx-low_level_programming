# In this project I built singly linked lists with C. 
A singly linked list in C is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or "pointer") to the next node in the list. The last node in the list typically has a reference to a null value, indicating the end of the list. Singly linked lists are useful for dynamic allocation of memory and for linear data structures, where data elements are stored in a sequential manner. To implement a singly linked list in C, a struct data structure is typically used to represent each node in the list, along with functions to manipulate the list, such as inserting or deleting nodes, or traversing the list
