# C - Variables, if, else, while
In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. 
I practiced declaring and defining variables of type char, int, and unsigned int, using if and if...else statements, and implementing while loops

## Tasks
* 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
* <1-last_digit.c> C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line 
* 2-print_alphabet.c: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice.
* 3-print_alphabets.c: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times.
* 4-print_alphabt.c: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters q and e, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice
* 5-print_numbers.c: C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* 6-print_numberz.c: C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice without any variables of type char
* 7-print_tebahpla.c: C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly twice
* 8-print_base16.c: C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function exactly three times
* 9-print_comb.c: C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the putchar function exactly four times without any variables of type char
* 10-print_comb2.c: C program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99 using only the putchar function exactly five times without any variables of type char
* 100-print_comb3.c: C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the putchar function exactly five times without any variables of type char
* 101-print_comb4.c: C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the putchar function exactly six times without any variables of type char
* 102-print_comb5.c: C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using only the putchar function exactly eight times without any variables of type char
